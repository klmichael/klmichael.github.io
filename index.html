                    Thank you for visiting my portfolio today.<br>
                    <br>
                    I started training as a web developer in July 2021.<br>

                <p>I spent nearly 17 years in fundraising. While I occasionally worked directly with donors, most of my roles were “behind the scenes”. My favorite workdays were always the ones I spent:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Solving problems</li>
                        <li>Organizing and analyzing details</li>
                        <li>Developing or implementing processes</li>
                        <li>Writing</li>
                        <li>Presenting</li>
                        <li>Learning new software</li>
                    </ul>
                I often wished I had a more technical skill set to offer, which helped me decide to change careers from fund development to web development in 2021.<br>
                <br>
                I’m currently enrolled in a three-part web development bootcamp through MIT xPRO. I learned HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the first course, and look forward to tackling front-end development with React next. I’ll finish my studies in April 2022.<br>
                <br>
                I’m currently open to networking, internships and job opportunities.
