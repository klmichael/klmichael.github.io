            <p>From jigsaw puzzles to mystery novels to ancient Greek – I love methodically working through details until that eureka moment. In my first career – 17 years in fundraising – I gravitated towards team roles that involved data, analysis, teaching/training, writing, and mastering software. A mid-pandemic layoff provided me with a wonderful opportunity to change vocations.<br>
            <br>
            I’m currently enrolled in a web development bootcamp through MIT Xpro. I’ve learned HTML, CSS and JavaScript and look forward to tackling the MERN stack next. So far, I’ve been most intrigued by programming with maps, working with large datasets and test-driven development.<br>
            <br>
            I’m currently open to networking, internships and job opportunities. You can get in touch with me via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kathryn-michael-17a84036/">LinkedIn</a>. Please visit my <a href="https://github.com/klmichael/">GitHub</a> too. Thank you!
